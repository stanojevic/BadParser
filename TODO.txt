done:
4) during validation we should print F1 on both full  sentences and on sentences with length < 40
3) during validation we should measure
    a) how many sentences we parse per second
    b) how many words per second
    c) figure out how to show the length of sentence vs speed of parsing correlation
5) check which sentences give infinite loss
11) report #of transitions in training & prediction time

on notice:

the rest:
6) lazy swaps
7) lazier swaps

14) try SGD instead of ADAM

1) bidirectional lstm at the leafs
8) char embeddings
9) pretrained embeddings

10) recurrence in the configuration representation
12) be able to turn off buffer, action or stack
13) be able to turn off composition function

15) Tree-LSTM and Phong-LSTM
