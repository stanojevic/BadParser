from dynet tutorial  http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials_notebooks/API.html:
            # lookup parameters can be initialized from an existing array, i.e:
            # m["lookup"].init_from_array(wv)

            e5  = lookup(lp, 5)   # create an Expression from row 5.
            e5c = lookup(lp, 5, update=False)  # as before, but don't update when optimizing.
            e5.set(9)   # now the e5 expression contains row 9
            e5c.set(9)  # ditto


the rest:

18) exclude sentences with infinite loss and count how many are there

10) recurrence in the configuration representation
12) be able to turn off buffer, action or stack
13) be able to turn off composition function

1) bidirectional lstm at the leafs
8) char embeddings (both bilstm and convolutional ones)
9) pretrained embeddings

15) Tree-LSTM and LeSTM

16) dropout on embeddings
17) word dropout

14) try SGD halving of the learning rate
