the rest:

18) automatic training, parsing and evaluation on all datasets



Lessons:

- node_size (recursive) matters (20 was good, 100 was bad)

- char & external embeddings help

unexplored:

- does conf_rep_size matter?

- layers for stack-lstm and for bi-lstm

- is bilstm needed?

- training pretrained embeddings?

- word dropout
