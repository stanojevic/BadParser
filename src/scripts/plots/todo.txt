milosh.stanojevic: the most important transition is of course number of swaps
milosh.stanojevic: others are not that import
milosh.stanojevic: we will have the same type of file for lazy and eager
milosh.stanojevic: and the plots should show the difference among them
milosh.stanojevic: maybe relative to the sentence length
milosh.stanojevic: x-axis: sentence length, y-axis: # of swaps
milosh.stanojevic: but try to show standard deviation or something
milosh.stanojevic: i think it will be lowest with laziest
rgalhama@gmail.com: yes i'll put error bars
rgalhama@gmail.com: or boxplots
rgalhama@gmail.com: i hope they don't override too much
rgalhama@gmail.com: i'll have to think sth creative otherwise
milosh.stanojevic: you can also try to make a plot for this /home/mstanoj1/experiments/2017_EMNLP_NPCNP/models/FINAL_mb_5_l2_0.0000001/parse_time_log/parse_time_8
milosh.stanojevic: in the simlar way
milosh.stanojevic: x-axis sentence lenght y-axis time taken to parse a sentence

milosh.stanojevic: it would be cool if we could show standard deviation like this http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/f2.gif
